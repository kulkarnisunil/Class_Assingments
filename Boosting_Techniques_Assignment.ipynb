        "\n",
        "Answer :   \n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique that combines multiple weak learners—simple models performing slightly better than random guessing—into a single strong learner with high predictive accuracy. It builds models sequentially, where each subsequent weak learner focuses on correcting the errors of the previous ones by assigning higher weights to misclassified training instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting starts by training the first weak learner, often a shallow decision tree, on the full dataset. Errors are then calculated, and weights are updated: instances misclassified by this learner get higher weights, while correctly classified ones get lower weights. The next weak learner trains on this reweighted dataset, emphasizing harder examples, and the process repeats for several iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**how it improves weak learners.**\n",
        "\n",
        "This sequential focus reduces bias and variance iteratively, as each learner contributes to the ensemble with a weight based on its performance—stronger performers influence the final prediction more. The final model aggregates predictions via weighted voting (classification) or averaging (regression), yielding superior accuracy compared to individual weak learners.\n"
