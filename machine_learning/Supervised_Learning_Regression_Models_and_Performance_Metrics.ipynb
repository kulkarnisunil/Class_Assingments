        "Answer :  \n",
        "\n",
        "* Logistic regression is a powerful statistical and machine learning technique that models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables. It transforms a linear combination of inputs using a logistic (sigmoid) function, which maps any real-valued number into a probability between 0 and 1. This makes it ideal for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the likelihood of an event occurring, such as whether an email is spam or a patient has a disease. Beyond simple prediction, logistic regression provides interpretable results about the influence of each predictor on the outcome, making it a preferred method in domains like healthcare, finance, and social sciences for both prediction and insight extraction. Its mathematical foundation using maximum likelihood estimation ensures robust parameter fitting even with complex relationships and mixed data types.\n",

        "R-squared is a statistical measure that indicates how well the independent variables in a regression model explain the variance of the dependent variable. It quantifies the proportion of the total variation in the outcome that is captured by the model, with values ranging from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better fit. This metric is used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model and to compare different models. However, R-squared alone does not guarantee that the model is appropriate, and adjusted R-squared is often preferred to account for the number of predictors and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In practice, R-squared helps you assess how well the models predictions match the actual data, allowing you to compare competing models and choose the one that best fits your data.\n"

        "\n",
        "The coefficient (slope) in a simple linear regression represents the expected change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. If the coefficient is positive, it means the dependent variable increases as the independent variable increases; if negative, it decreases. The intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. Together, they define the linear relationship between the predictor and outcome\n",

It indicates a positive linear relationship between height and weight.\n",
