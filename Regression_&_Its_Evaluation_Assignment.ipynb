        "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical and supervised machine learning method used to model the linear relationship between two variables — one independent (predictor) variable and one dependent (target) variable. It fits a straight line that best predicts the target variable from the input variable.\n",

        "**Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Linearity:  The Relationship between dependent variable(y) and independent variable is linear.This means a change in X leads to a proportional change in Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors: the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) in a regression model are not related or correlated with each other. means the error  get for one observation should not give any clue or predict the error you get for another observation.No autocorrelation exists, especially important in time-series data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity: the spread of errors or differences between actual and predicted values stays roughly the same no matter the value of X.ensure that the regression model estimates are reliable, efficient, and hypothesis tests valid and good model.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Residuals: The residuals are normally distributed, which allows for valid hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. No Multicollinearity:Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other(More relevant for multiple regression).\n",

        "Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables when the relationship is non-linear.

However, you detect heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity in your regression model. Explain the steps you would take to address these issues and ensure a robust model.\n",

        "\n",
        "Heteroscedasticity means the variance of the errors (residuals) in a regression model is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. In simpler terms, the spread of prediction errors changes with the size of the input variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Heteroscedasticity leads to inefficient and biased standard errors impacting inference.\n",
        "- It violates a key assumption of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\n",
        "-auses unreliable standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests.\n",
        "- Ultimately, it can give misleading conclusions about the impact of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithm influenced by heteroscedasticity:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Linear regression and other parametric regressions are affected.\n",
        "- Standard errors and p-values become unreliable.\n",
        "- Predictions might remain unbiased but less precise.\n",

        "Algirthm not influced by heteroscedasticity:\n",

        "\n",
        "**Steps to address Heteroscedasticity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Transform the dependent variable (e.g., apply a log transform to house prices) to stabilize variance.\n",
        "2. Use weighted least squares regression, giving less weight to data points with higher variance.this stabilizing the impact of outliers and variable errors.\n",
        "3. Redefine the dependent variable by using rates or ratios instead of raw values if appropriate.for example, For example, predicting price per square foot or price per room can reduce inherent variability.\n",
        "4. robust regression methods that are less sensitive to violations of constant variance, such as quantile regression or Theil-Sen estimators.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Multicollinearity :\n",
        "\n",
        "Multicollinearity means that two or more features (independent variables) in regression model are highly correlated with each other. This causes problems because it becomes hard to tell how each feature individually impacts the target (like house price), and the estimated effects can be unstable or misleading and reduce model interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithm influenced by Multicollinearity:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Linear Regression: Strongly affected because correlated predictors inflate coefficient variance and make estimates unstable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Logistic Regression: Also affected since its a form of regression, causing unstable odds ratio estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs): Similarly sensitive as their parameters are estimated via regression techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Stepwise Regression: Vulnerable due to reliance on coefficient significance.\n",

        "\n",
        "Algorithm not influenced by Multicollinearity:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Tree base model:  They split on features independently, so multicollinearity usually doesn't harm performance or coefficient interpretation.[decision tree,radnom forest,bagging and boosting]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks: They focus on decision boundaries rather than coefficient estimates, so multicollinearity is less critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes: Not affected by coefficient interpretation issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps to address Multicollinearity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for the features to detect highly correlated predictors.Drop one of the features with a high VIF if it does not harm model performance significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Remove or combine correlated features, such as merging similar variables or using domain knowledge to retain the most relevant ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) if many features are correlated.[combine correlated features into a single uncorrelated component—although this can affect interpretability]\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use regularization methods like Ridge or Lasso regression, which penalize large coefficients and reduce multicollinearity effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps for Ensuring a Robust Model:**       \n",
        "\n",
        "1.\n",
        "    - start by visualizing data with scatterplots and residual plots to spot patterns, outliers, and unequal error spread.\n",
        "    - calculate VIF to detect if any predictors are highly correlated, which can affect model reliability.\n",
        "    - This helps us find problems early and understand data's structure before modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Apply cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the model and to ensure that mitigation strategies (like regularization or transformation) improve out-of-sample predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. compare performance before and after addressing these issues to ensure better and stable predictions.or use alternative algorithm such as ensemble methods or robust regressors\n",
        "\n",
        "**In this case,predicting house prices with features like area, rooms, and location—start with exploratory data analysis to find signs of heteroscedasticity (residual plots vs. fitted values) and multicollinearity (correlation matrix, VIF). Then, follow with log transformation of prices, check VIF for predictors, and consider ridge regression for both predictive power and interpretability. Carry out these steps iteratively, validating and tuning at each stage to produce a model ready for production deployment**\n"
