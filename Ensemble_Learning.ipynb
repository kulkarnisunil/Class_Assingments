Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data (bootstrapping) and at each split, it considers a random subset of features, making the trees diverse. For classification, each tree votes for a class, and the forest chooses the class with the majority vote as the final prediction. This approach reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree and improves accuracy and robustness. It's widely used for both classification and regression tasks."

Each model learns slightly different patterns because the data subsets vary. When predicting, bagging averages the results (regression) or uses majority vote (classification) of all models. This averaging smooths out the noise and random fluctuations that a single model might fit to (overfit), leading to more stable and generalized predictions on new data. So, bagging lowers variance and prevents models from memorizing training noise. This works especially well with high-variance models like decision trees"
